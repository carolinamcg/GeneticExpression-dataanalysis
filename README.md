# GeneticExpression-dataanalysis

Analysis of genetic data (regnancy Associated Breast Cancer and non-Pregnancy Associated Breast Cancer), exploring  the concepts of  Pandas, Mathplotlib, Numpy, Sklearn libraries as well as ML concept. 

The dataset contains 33 samples, from malignant epithelium and normal tissue (stroma), in subjects with pregnancy-associated breast cancer (PABC) and in subjects with the same cancer but not associated with pregnancy (n-PABC).  In the files meta-gds4766.csv and gds4766.csv are the characteristics and the gene expression data for each sample, respectively.

Dataset size:

Data: Genes x Samples ------> (54675, 33)

Meta: Samples x Variables --> (33, 6)


There is a greater aggressiveness of breast cancer in pregnant women when compared to the same type of cancer in non-pregnant women. Thus, this code intends to analyze the available files in order to discover the characteristics of PABC that explain the differences of this cancer in relation to n-PABC.
